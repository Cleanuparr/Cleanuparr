# Using Cleanuparr's blocklist feature (torrent)

1. Enable both `Queue Cleaner`.
2. Enable `Content Blocker` and configure either a **blacklist** or a **whitelist** for each *arr.
3. Once configured, Cleanuparr will perform the following tasks:
   - Execute the **Content Blocker** job, as explained in the [How it works](/docs/how_it_works) section.
   - Execute the **Queue Cleaner** job, as explained in the [How it works](/docs/how_it_works) section.

<Note>
    This scenario is an example for blocking malicious files. Other features can be included here by configuring the environment variables.
