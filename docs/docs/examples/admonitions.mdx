# Using Admonitions in MDX

This page demonstrates how to use the Admonition components directly in MDX files.

## Basic Usage

You can use the `Note`, `Warning`, and `Important` components directly in your MDX files:

<Note>
  This is a note admonition created directly in MDX.
</Note>

<Warning>
  This is a warning admonition created directly in MDX.
</Warning>

<Important>
  This is an important admonition created directly in MDX.
</Important>

## With Multiple Paragraphs

You can include multiple paragraphs in your admonitions:

<Note>
  This is the first paragraph of a note.
  
  This is the second paragraph of the same note.
</Note>

## With Markdown Content

You can include markdown content inside your admonitions:

<Important>
  **Bold text** and *italic text* work inside admonitions.
  
  - List items
  - Also work
  - Inside admonitions
  
  ```js
  // Code blocks also work
  const example = "This is a code block inside an admonition";
  console.log(example);
  ```
