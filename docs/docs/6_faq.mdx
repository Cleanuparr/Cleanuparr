<ConfigSection
  id="why-cleanuparr-name"
  title="Why is it called Cleanuparr and not X or Y?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="General"
>

The name `Cleanuparr` reflects its purpose: to clean up your *arr applications. The `arr` suffix is a nod to the [Servarr](https://wiki.servarr.com/) ecosystem that it supports.
Other names were already taken or I just didn't like them.

<ConfigSection
  id="private-trackers"
  title="Can I use Cleanuparr with private torrents/trackers?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="General"
>

Yes, Cleanuparr works with private torrents and trackers just like public ones. Depending on the availability, some private trackers can also have slow or stalled torrents.

Configurations such as never removing private torrents are available, but a direct connection to your download client is required for that, otherwise it can't know which ones are private.

However, you should still be cautious with aggressive strike rules and make sure your configuration is appropriate for your use case.

<Important>
Always test your configuration in dry run mode first, especially when setting up strike rules or malware blocking patterns.

<ConfigSection
  id="usenet-support"
  title="Is Usenet supported? Will it be supported in the future?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="General"
>

Failed imports are handled regardless of the download client, so Usenet users can benefit from using it.

But on a broader spectrum, Cleanuparr <b><i>will not</i></b> be adding native Usenet support, mainly because:
- I am not using Usenet myself, so I can't properly test or maintain it.
- People asking for Usenet support offered no help with development or testing, as seen [here](https://github.com/Cleanuparr/Cleanuparr/issues/137) and [here](https://github.com/Cleanuparr/Cleanuparr/issues/226).

Probably not.

<ConfigSection
  id="linux-docker-flavors"
  title="Will X flavor of Linux or the Y flavor of Docker be supported?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="General"
>

No. Executables and Docker containers for every major platform are already provided, which should work on any modern Linux distribution or Docker environment.

<ConfigSection

  title="Does it have an Unraid template?"
  icon="❓"

Read the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation/detailed?unraid)!

<ConfigSection
  id="linux-docker-flavors"
  title="What does Cleanuparr do differently compared to X or Y similar tool?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="General"

You be the judge.

There's a list of [features](/docs/features) that you can compare against other tools, [configuration docs](/docs/category/configuration) to explore the available customizations, or just install it and try it out.

<ConfigSection
  id="not-blocking"
  title="The same release keeps comming back even after Cleanuparr blocked it. Why?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="Features"

Read the [Prerequisites](/docs/installation)!

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  id="strike-system"
  title="What is the strike system and how does it work?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="Features"
>

The strike system prevents false positives by requiring multiple violations before taking action:

1. **Detection**: Cleanuparr detects a problem (stalled, slow, failed import)
2. **Strike Issued**: The download receives a strike (logged and tracked)
3. **Accumulation**: Each time the job runs and the problem persists, another strike is added
4. **Action**: When strikes reach the configured maximum (default: 3), the download is removed and blocked

**Why it matters**: A temporarily slow download due to network issues won't be removed immediately. Only consistently problematic downloads are removed.

**Configuration**: You can adjust the maximum strikes per rule type in the <Link to="/docs/configuration/queue-cleaner">Queue Cleaner settings</Link>.

<ConfigSection
  id="dry-run-mode"
  title="What is dry run mode and should I use it?"
  icon="❓"
  badge="Features"
>

Dry run mode simulates what Cleanuparr would do **without actually doing it**:

- Downloads are NOT removed
- Strikes are NOT issued
- Searches are NOT triggered
- Actions are logged as `[DRY RUN]`

**When to use it**:
- Testing new configuration
- Validating strike rules
- Checking what would be affected by changes
- Learning how Cleanuparr works
- Before going live with aggressive rules

**How to enable**: Go to Settings → General → Enable Dry Run

<Note>
Always test configuration changes in dry run mode first, especially for critical production systems.
