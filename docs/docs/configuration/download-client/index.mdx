# Download Client Configuration

Configure download client connections for torrents and usenet. Cleanuparr supports qBittorrent, Deluge, and Transmission download clients.

## Client Management

Download clients are managed as individual instances. You can add multiple clients of the same or different types to handle various download workflows.

### Supported Client Types

- **qBittorrent**: Most popular, feature-rich torrent client
- **Deluge**: Lightweight, daemon-based torrent client  
- **Transmission**: Simple, cross-platform torrent client

## Client Configuration

### Enable Download Client {#enable-download-client}

**Field**: `enabled`  
**Type**: Boolean  
**Default**: `true`

Controls whether this download client instance is active and will be used by Cleanuparr for operations.

**When Enabled**:
- Client will be available for queue operations
- Health checks will monitor this client
- All configured features will apply to this client

**When Disabled**:
- Client will be ignored by all Cleanuparr operations
- No health checks will be performed
- Useful for temporarily disabling without deleting configuration

**Best Practice**: Disable clients during maintenance rather than deleting their configuration.

### Client Name {#client-name}

**Field**: `name`  
**Type**: String  
**Required**: Yes

A descriptive name to identify this download client instance in the Cleanuparr interface.

**Examples**:
- `qBittorrent Main`
- `Seedbox qBittorrent`
- `Local Deluge`
- `4K Movies Transmission`

**Best Practices**:
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose or location
- Include client type if managing multiple types
- Keep names short but meaningful for easy identification

### Client Type {#client-type}

**Field**: `type`  
**Type**: Dropdown Selection  
**Required**: Yes  
**Options**: qBittorrent, Deluge, Transmission

Specifies which download client software this configuration connects to.

**qBittorrent**:
- Most feature-rich option
- Web UI on port 8080 by default
- Supports categories, tags, and ratios
- Best compatibility with Cleanuparr features

**Deluge**:
- Lightweight daemon-based client
- Web UI on port 8112 by default  
- Good for resource-constrained systems
- Supports plugins and advanced configurations

**Transmission**:
- Simple, cross-platform client
- Web UI on port 9091 by default
- Minimal resource usage
- Basic but reliable functionality

**Important**: Client type cannot be changed after creation. Delete and recreate if needed.

### Client Host {#client-host}

**Field**: `host`  
**Type**: URL  
**Required**: Yes

The complete URL to access your download client's web interface.

**Format**: `protocol://hostname:port`

**Examples**:
- `http://localhost:8080` (local qBittorrent)
- `https://seedbox.example.com:8080` (remote qBittorrent with SSL)
- `http://192.168.1.100:8112` (local network Deluge)
- `http://transmission.lan:9091` (local Transmission)

**Protocol Requirements**:
- Must use `http://` or `https://`
- HTTPS recommended for remote connections
- HTTP acceptable for local/trusted networks

**Port Guidelines**:
- qBittorrent: Usually 8080
- Deluge: Usually 8112  
- Transmission: Usually 9091
- Check your client's web UI settings for the actual port

**Common Issues**:
- Ensure firewall allows the port
- Check that web UI is enabled in client settings
- Verify URL is accessible from Cleanuparr's location

### URL Base Path {#url-base-path}

**Field**: `urlBase`  
**Type**: String (Optional)

URL path prefix if your download client runs behind a reverse proxy with a subpath.

**When to Use**:
- Client accessed via reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, Traefik)
- Client uses non-root URL path
- Multiple services share same domain/port

**Examples**:
- `/qbittorrent` → Full URL: `http://domain.com/qbittorrent`
- `/downloads/deluge` → Full URL: `http://domain.com/downloads/deluge`
- `/transmission` → Full URL: `http://domain.com/transmission`

**Format Rules**:
- Start with forward slash (`/`)
- No trailing slash
- Use lowercase, hyphens for readability
- Match your reverse proxy configuration exactly

**Configuration Notes**:
- Leave empty if accessing client directly (no proxy)
- Must match reverse proxy path configuration
- Test URL manually before saving

## Authentication

### Authentication Username {#authentication-username}

**Field**: `username`  
**Type**: String (Optional)

Username for download client authentication if required.

**When Required**:
- Client has authentication enabled
- Accessing client over network/internet
- Multiple users share same client

**When Not Needed**:
- Client runs locally without authentication
- Client configured for no-auth local access
- Using alternative authentication methods

**Security Considerations**:
- Use dedicated user account for Cleanuparr
- Limit permissions to necessary operations only
- Regular client may not need admin privileges

### Authentication Password {#authentication-password}

**Field**: `password`  
**Type**: Password (Optional)

Password for download client authentication.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Consider client-specific credentials
- Store securely and rotate regularly
- Use HTTPS when sending over network

**Client-Specific Notes**:
- **qBittorrent**: Web UI username/password
- **Deluge**: Web UI password (username often not required)
- **Transmission**: HTTP authentication if enabled

## Connection Testing

After configuring a download client, Cleanuparr will:

1. **Test Connection**: Verify URL accessibility
2. **Authenticate**: Log in using provided credentials  
3. **API Check**: Confirm client API compatibility
4. **Health Monitor**: Ongoing connection monitoring

**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**:

- **Connection Failed**: Check host URL, port, firewall
- **Authentication Failed**: Verify username/password
- **API Error**: Ensure client version compatibility
- **Timeout**: Check network latency, increase timeout settings

## Multiple Client Setup

You can configure multiple download clients for different purposes:

**Use Cases**:
- **Primary/Backup**: Main client with fallback option
- **Content Separation**: Movies vs TV shows vs music
- **Performance Tiers**: Fast SSD vs slower storage
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multiple seedbox locations

**Configuration Strategy**:
- Use descriptive names for each client
- Test each client independently
- Monitor performance across all clients
- Configure appropriate settings per client purpose

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- **Local Clients**: Use HTTP for speed
- **Remote Clients**: Use HTTPS for security
- **Network Clients**: Consider connection pooling
- **Multiple Clients**: Balance load appropriately

### Security Considerations

- **Credentials**: Use least-privilege accounts
- **Network**: Secure client web interfaces
- **Access**: Limit administrative functions
- **Monitoring**: Enable logging for security events

### Maintenance Tips

- **Regular Testing**: Verify connections periodically
- **Update Coordination**: Keep client versions compatible
- **Backup Configuration**: Export settings before changes
- **Documentation**: Maintain client setup notes
