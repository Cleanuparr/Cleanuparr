# General

General configuration settings that apply to the entire Cleanuparr application.

<ElementNavigator />

<div className={styles.documentationPage}>

<div className={styles.section}>

<SectionTitle icon="⚙️">System Settings</SectionTitle>

<ConfigSection
  title="Display Support Banner"
  icon="🎗️"
>

Shows the support section on the dashboard with links to GitHub and sponsors.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Dry Run"
  icon="🧪"
>

Logs all operations without making changes. Test your configuration safely before enabling live deletions and notifications.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Status Check"
  icon="📡"
>

Periodically checks for new Cleanuparr versions. Disable this if your environment has restricted outbound network access.

<Note>
When disabled, the version check and "update available" notification in the sidebar will not appear.
</Note>

</ConfigSection>

</div>

<div className={styles.section}>

<SectionTitle icon="🔐">Authentication</SectionTitle>

<ConfigSection
  title="Disable Auth for Local Addresses"
  icon="🏠"
>

Bypass authentication for requests originating from local network addresses. When enabled, users on the local network can access Cleanuparr without logging in.

**Built-in trusted ranges:**
- `127.0.0.0/8` / `::1` (localhost)
- `10.0.0.0/8` (Class A private)
- `172.16.0.0/12` (Class B private)
- `192.168.0.0/16` (Class C private)
- IPv6 link-local (`fe80::`) and unique-local (`fd00::`) addresses

<Warning>
Only enable this if your Cleanuparr instance is not exposed to the internet. Anyone on your local network will have full access without authentication.
</Warning>

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Trust Forwarded Headers"
  icon="🔀"
>

When running behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx, Caddy, Traefik), enable this to use `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers to determine the client's real IP address instead of the proxy's address.

<Warning>
Only enable this if you are using a reverse proxy. Forwarded headers are only trusted when the direct connection comes from a local address, preventing spoofing from remote attackers.
</Warning>

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Additional Trusted Networks"
  icon="🌐"
>

Add custom IP addresses or CIDR ranges that should bypass authentication, in addition to the built-in local address ranges.

**Examples:**
```
192.168.1.0/24
10.0.50.0/24
172.20.0.5
```

</ConfigSection>

</div>

<div className={styles.section}>

<SectionTitle icon="🌐">HTTP Configuration</SectionTitle>

<ConfigSection
  title="HTTP Max Retries"
  icon="🔄"
>

Number of retry attempts for failed HTTP requests to *arrs, download clients, and other services.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="HTTP Timeout"
  icon="⏱️"
>

Seconds to wait before timing out HTTP requests to *arrs, download clients, and other services.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="HTTP Certificate Validation"
  icon="🔒"
>

SSL certificate validation for HTTPS connections.

**Options:**
- **Enabled:** Validate all SSL certificates
- **Disabled for Local Addresses:** Skip validation for local/private IP addresses only
- **Disabled:** Skip all validation (not recommended)

</ConfigSection>

<div className={styles.section}>

<SectionTitle icon="🔍">Search Settings</SectionTitle>

<ConfigSection
  title="Search Enabled"
  icon="✅"
>

Automatically search for replacements after removing downloads from *arr apps.

<Note>
If using [Huntarr](https://github.com/plexguide/Huntarr.io), disable this to let Huntarr handle searching.
</Note>

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Search Delay"
  icon="⏳"
>

Seconds to wait before triggering replacement searches. Prevents overwhelming indexers with rapid requests.

<Warning>
A lower value will result in faster searches, but may cause issues such as being rate limited or banned by the indexer.
</Warning>

</ConfigSection>

</div>

<div className={styles.section}>

<SectionTitle icon="📦">Download Management</SectionTitle>

<ConfigSection
  title="Ignored Downloads"
  icon="🚯"
>

Downloads matching these patterns are skipped during all cleaning operations. Match by:
- Torrent hash
- qBittorrent tag or category
- Deluge label
- Transmission category (last directory from the save location)
- µTorrent label
- Tracker domain

**Examples:**
```
fa800a7d7c443a2c3561d1f8f393c089036dade1
tv-sonarr
qbit-tag
mytracker.com
```

</ConfigSection>

<div className={styles.section}>

<SectionTitle icon="🗃️">State Management</SectionTitle>

<ConfigSection
  title="Strike Inactivity Window"
  icon="⏳"
>

Controls how long strike data is retained using a **sliding window**. Strikes for a download are automatically cleaned up after the download goes this many hours without receiving a new strike.

**How it works:**
- The window resets every time a new strike is recorded for a download
- As long as a download keeps getting new strikes, all of its strike history is preserved
- Once a download stops receiving strikes for the configured number of hours, all of its strikes are removed
- This effectively means: "forget about downloads that haven't been problematic recently"

**Example:** With a value of `72` hours (3 days):
- Download A receives strikes on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. On Saturday (72 hours after the last strike on Wednesday), all of its strikes are cleaned up.
- Download B receives a strike on Monday. On Thursday (72 hours later), its strike is cleaned up.
- Download C receives strikes on Monday and Thursday. The window resets on Thursday, so cleanup happens on Sunday (72 hours after Thursday).

<Note>
Lower values clean up strikes faster, but may cause Cleanuparr to re-strike downloads it has already dealt with. This value needs to be adjusted based on your Queue Cleaner run interval.
</Note>

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Purge All Strikes"
  icon="🧹"
>

Immediately and permanently deletes all strike data for all downloads. This resets all strike counters to zero.

<Warning>
This action cannot be undone. All downloads will start with zero strikes after a purge, which means previously problematic downloads may need to accumulate strikes again before being acted upon.
</Warning>

<div className={styles.section}>

<SectionTitle icon="📝">Logging Settings</SectionTitle>

<ConfigSection
  title="Log Level"
  icon="📊"
>

Controls log detail level. Lower levels include all higher-level messages.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Rolling Size (MB)"
  icon="📐"
>

Maximum log file size before creating a new file. Larger values mean fewer files but bigger individual file sizes.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Retained File Count"
  icon="🗂️"
>

Number of non-archived log files to keep. Older files are removed or archived based on your settings.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Time Limit"
  icon="⏳"
>

Maximum age for non-archived logs. Older files are removed or archived based on your settings.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Archive Enabled"
  icon="🗄️"
>

Archive old log files instead of deleting them. Preserves history while reducing disk usage through compression.

<Note>
Recommended if Cleanuparr generates many logs on your setup.
</Note>

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  title="Archive Retained Count"
  icon="🧾"
>

Number of archived log files to keep. Older archives are deleted.

</ConfigSection>
