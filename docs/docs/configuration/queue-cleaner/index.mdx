# Queue Cleaner

The Queue Cleaner monitors your download client's queue and automatically removes downloads based on configurable criteria. This helps keep your queue clean and prevents problematic downloads from consuming resources.

### Enable Queue Cleaner {#enable-queue-cleaner}

When enabled, the Queue Cleaner will run according to the configured schedule to automatically clean downloads from your download client queue.

<hr />

### Scheduling Mode {#scheduling-mode}

Choose how to configure the Queue Cleaner schedule:
- **Basic**: Simple interval-based scheduling (every X minutes/hours/seconds)
- **Advanced**: Full cron expression control for complex schedules

<hr />

### Cron Expression {#cron-expression}

Enter a valid Quartz cron expression to control when the Queue Cleaner runs. The example above runs every 5 minutes.

**Common Cron Examples:**
- `0 0/5 * ? * * *` - Every 5 minutes
- `0 0 * ? * * *` - Every hour
- `0 0 */6 ? * * *` - Every 6 hours

## Failed Import Settings

### Failed Import Max Strikes {#failed-import-max-strikes}

Number of strikes before a failed import download is removed from the queue. Set to 0 to disable failed import cleaning, minimum 3 to enable.

<hr />

### Failed Import Ignore Private {#failed-import-ignore-private}

When enabled, private torrents will be skipped during failed import cleaning. This is useful if you want to preserve private tracker content even when imports fail.

<Important>
    This setting needs a download client to be configured.
</Important>

<hr />

### Failed Import Delete Private {#failed-import-delete-private}

When enabled, private torrents that reach the maximum strikes will be deleted from the download client. Use with caution as this will permanently remove the download.

    Setting this to true means private torrents will be permanently deleted, potentially affecting your private tracker account by receiving H&R if the seeding requirements are not met.
</Warning>

<Important>
    This setting needs a download client to be configured.
</Important>

<hr />

### Failed Import Ignored Patterns {#failed-import-ignored-patterns}

**Examples:**
- `title mismatch`
- `manual import required`
- `recently aired`

Failed imports containing these patterns in their name will be skipped during cleaning. Useful for avoiding removal of legitimate downloads that may have temporary import issues.

<hr />

<Important>
    These settings need a download client to be configured.
