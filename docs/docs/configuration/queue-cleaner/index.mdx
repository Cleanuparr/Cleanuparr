# Queue Cleaner

The Queue Cleaner monitors your *arr's queues and automatically removes downloads based on configurable criteria. This helps keep your queue clean and prevents problematic downloads from being stuck.

<div className={styles.documentationPage}>

<div className={styles.section}>

<ConfigSection
  id="enable-queue-cleaner"
  title="Enable Queue Cleaner"
  icon="üîÑ"
>

When enabled, the Queue Cleaner will run according to the configured schedule to automatically clean downloads from your download client queue.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  id="scheduling-mode"
  title="Scheduling Mode"
  icon="üìÖ"
>

Choose how to configure the Queue Cleaner schedule:
- **Basic**: Simple interval-based scheduling (every X minutes/hours/seconds)
- **Advanced**: Full cron expression control for complex schedules

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  id="cron-expression"
  title="Cron Expression"
  icon="‚è≤Ô∏è"
>

Enter a valid Quartz cron expression to control when the Queue Cleaner runs.

**Common Cron Examples:**
- `0 0/5 * ? * * *` - Every 5 minutes
- `0 0 * ? * * *` - Every hour
- `0 0 */6 ? * * *` - Every 6 hours

</ConfigSection>

</div>

<div className={styles.section}>

<ConfigSection
  id="ignored-downloads"
  title="Ignored Downloads"
  icon="üö´"
>

Downloads matching these patterns will be ignored by Queue Cleaner. Patterns can match any of these:
- torrent hash
- qBittorrent tag or category
- Deluge label
- Transmission category (last directory from the save location)
- ¬µTorrent label
- torrent tracker domain

**Examples:**
```
fa800a7d7c443a2c3561d1f8f393c089036dade1
tv-sonarr
qbit-tag
mytracker.com
```

  Failed Import Settings
</h2>

<ConfigSection
  id="failed-import-max-strikes"
  title="Failed Import Max Strikes"
  icon="‚ö°"
>

Number of strikes before a failed import download is removed from the queue. Set to 0 to disable failed import cleaning, minimum 3 to enable.

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  id="failed-import-ignore-private"
  title="Failed Import Ignore Private"
  icon="üîí"
>

When enabled, private torrents will be skipped during failed import cleaning. This is useful if you want to preserve private tracker content even when imports fail.

<EnhancedImportant>
This setting needs a download client to be configured.
</EnhancedImportant>

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  id="failed-import-delete-private"
  title="Failed Import Delete Private"
  icon="üóëÔ∏è"
>

When enabled, private torrents that reach the maximum strikes will be deleted from the download client. Use with caution as this will permanently remove the download.

<EnhancedWarning>
Setting this to true means private torrents will be permanently deleted, potentially affecting your private tracker account by receiving H&R if the seeding requirements are not met.
</EnhancedWarning>

<EnhancedImportant>
This setting needs a download client to be configured.
</EnhancedImportant>

</ConfigSection>

<ConfigSection
  id="failed-import-ignored-patterns"
  title="Failed Import Ignored Patterns"
  icon="üìù"
>

**Examples:**
- `title mismatch`
- `manual import required`
- `recently aired`

Failed imports containing these patterns in their name will be skipped during cleaning. Useful for avoiding removal of legitimate downloads that may have temporary import issues.
